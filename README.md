## Rijksmuseum Web API

### Project Topic

Rijksmuseum API project includes webpages that consume the museum Web API <br/>
and expose Rijksmuseum paintings, the paintings' artists list, and their info.

### Notes

This projects' code is written in jQuery framework. jQuery is a good tool, <br/> 
but my post work suggestions is that for too comprehensive code use Angular <br/> 
framework may be not bad idea.
